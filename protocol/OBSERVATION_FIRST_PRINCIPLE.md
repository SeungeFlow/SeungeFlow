# SeungeFlow Observation-First Principle

SeungeFlow operates on an observation-first basis.

Understanding does not begin from structure,
nor from design,
but from recorded observation.

Every thought, perception, or recognition
is first treated as an event.

Structure is not imposed.
Structure emerges from accumulation.

Therefore:

- Record first.
- Interpret later.
- Do not restructure past observations.
- Allow density to reveal patterns.

SeungeFlow is not a system that predicts meaning.
It is a system where meaning emerges from recorded flow.

Observation precedes structure.  
Flow precedes interpretation.
