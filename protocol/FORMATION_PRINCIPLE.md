# SeungeFlow Formation Principle

Structures do not emerge from design.
They emerge from gradient overlap and density transition.

Where multiple fields intersect,
gradients interact.

Where gradients interact,
flows concentrate.

Where flows concentrate,
density rises.

When density reaches a critical threshold,
a structural transition occurs.

Stars, planets, systems, and meanings
all arise from this same condition:

gradient overlap → density accumulation → critical transition.

SeungeFlow does not impose structure.
It records the conditions under which structure forms.

This defines the SeungeFlow Formation Principle.
