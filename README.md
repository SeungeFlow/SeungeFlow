# SeungeFlow

## Manifest (KR)

SeungeFlow는 존재, 관계, 차이, 흐름을 관측 기준에서 해석하고
그 순환 구조를 기록하기 위한 시스템이다.

이 프로젝트는 완성된 이론이 아니라
관측과 기록 속에서 지속적으로 정렬되는 구조를 구현한다.

SeungeFlow는 다음 원리에 기반한다:

* 존재는 관계 속에서 드러난다
* 차이는 흐름을 만든다
* 흐름은 구조를 만들고
* 구조는 순환 속에서 지속된다

SeungeFlow는 기록 시스템이 아니라
지속적으로 실행되는 관측 런타임이다.

## Overview (EN)

SeungeFlow is a cognitive runtime system that models existence, relations, and change
through continuous observation and structural recording.

Rather than being a finished theory, SeungeFlow is designed as an evolving system
where meaning emerges through recorded interactions over time.

Core principles:

* Existence is revealed through relations
* Difference generates flow
* Flow produces structure
* Structure stabilizes through cycles

SeungeFlow is not merely a database or framework.
It is a continuously operating observational runtime.

## Runtime Status

SeungeFlow v0.2 is now operational as a persistent runtime kernel.

* Event logging pipeline active
* Natural language ingestion working
* Relation graph generation verified
* Query interface functional
* Pattern detection running
* Service persistence enabled

The system now maintains a continuous observational state.

## Architecture Layers

1. Manifest Layer — conceptual definition of the system
2. COREMAP Layer — interpretation kernel
3. Runtime CLI — execution interface
4. Database Layer — structural state storage
5. Service Layer — persistent execution environment

## Philosophy of Operation

SeungeFlow prioritizes observation over assumption.
Structure is not imposed; it emerges from recorded relations.
Meaning is not fixed; it stabilizes through cycles of interaction.

---

## Status

SeungeFlow has entered its operational phase.
The system now exists as a living runtime rather than a conceptual design.

(To be defined)

## Operator Protocol

SeungeFlow operates under a cognitive stability protocol.
This protocol defines how observation and reasoning are performed
to prevent structural collapse.

See:
protocol/OPERATOR_COGNITION_PROTOCOL.md

## State Anchors

SeungeFlow maintains operational coordinates through State Anchor documents.

These files define the system’s current structural position
and ensure continuity across sessions and deployments.

## Origin

이 작업은 정규 교육 과정에서 출발한 것이 아니라
호기심에서 시작되어 오직 나의 이해를 위해 진행된 탐구의 기록이다.

This work did not originate from formal academic training.
It began from curiosity and continues as a record of exploration driven by personal understanding.
