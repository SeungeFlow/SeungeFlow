# SeungeFlow State Anchor

date: 2026-02-22  
type: session_state  
status: stabilized  

This document fixes the current structural position of SeungeFlow.
It is not a design document or log.
It defines the operational coordinate of the system.

---

## Structural Status

SeungeFlow has completed Outer Structure Stabilization.

The system now exists as a cognitive stabilization runtime
composed of:

- Runtime Kernel
- Persistent Service
- Structured Database
- Release history
- Core documentation
- Operator Cognition Protocol

These elements now function as a unified operational base.

## Concept Fixations

Time is defined as:
“a positional shift at the point of contact.”

Vector is defined as:
“a mark where difference becomes flow.”

Meaning is defined as:
“emergence between two entities.”

---

## Base Recognition Pattern

The foundational perception symbols are defined as:

- ㆍ : initiation point  
- ㅡ : expansion plane  
- ㅣ : structural axis  

Structural recognition proceeds through
crossing, interaction, and relational interpretation.

---

## Session Conclusion

This session has completed:

- concept stabilization
- structural indexing
- operational anchoring

Subsequent work proceeds toward:

- system memory preservation structure
- recording layer refinement

---

This document represents the current coordinate of SeungeFlow.
Future work must align with this state anchor.
